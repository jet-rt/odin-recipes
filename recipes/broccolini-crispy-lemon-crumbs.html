    <p><h3>Description</h3>
    This is a simple and delicious vegetable side dish which involves blanching broccolini quickly, then saut√©ing it on the stove with a shallot and adding spicy, lemony, homemade bread crumbs at the very end. (Make ahead: The lemon crumbs can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days.)</p>
    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2 slices of white bread, torn</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>2 bunches Broccolini (approx. 225 grams each), ends trimmed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 small shallot, very finely chopped</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges, for serving</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p><h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>In a food processor, pulse the white bread until large crumbs form.</li> 
        <li>In a large skillet, melt the butter. Add the bread crumbs and cook them over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until golden.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat, stir in the crushed red pepper and lemon zest and season with salt. Transfer the crumbs to a plate to cool. Wipe out the skillet.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the Broccolini and cook until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Drain well, shaking off the excess water; pat dry.</li>
        <li>In the large skillet, heat the olive oil until shimmering. Add the shallot and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until lightly browned, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add the broccolini, season lightly with salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the Broccolini is lightly browned in spots, about 4 minutes. </li>
        <li>Transfer the broccolini to a serving platter and sprinkle the lemony bread crumbs on top. Serve right away with lemon wedges.</li>
